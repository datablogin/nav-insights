Love this question. Short version: keep your analyzers as the “facts engine,” then add a **small, locally-served reasoning layer** that’s 80% deterministic rules + 20% tiny LLM to write/explain and cover edge cases. That gives you repeatability, low cost, and IP safety—without depending on a commercial API.

Below is a concrete, drop-in architecture that fits your repo and infra.

# Target architecture (hybrid, rules-first)

1. **Facts layer (you already have this)**

* Use your existing analyzers and scheduler as the authoritative signal generator. Normalize their outputs into a typed **Findings IR** (pydantic models) stored per audit. This mirrors your modular layout, REST API, workflows, and observability that are already in place.  &#x20;

2. **Reasoning layer (new)**

* **Decision Tables + Rules** (deterministic): YAML decision tables evaluated over the Findings IR produce **Actions** (what to change) and **Justifications** (why). Start with \~50–150 compact rules to cover your steady-state cases (e.g., broad>40% & QS<5 ⇒ propose match tightening with dollar impact).
* **Tiny LLM (on-prem)** for:

  * drafting readable narratives (“executive summary,” “what changed since last quarter”);
  * handling long-tail/ambiguous cases when rules don’t fire confidently;
  * turning actions into clean “explain-like-I’m-an-operator” text blocks.
* **Structured output only**: force the model to return JSON that fits your pydantic schemas; reject/retry on validation failure. (Libraries like Guardrails or native pydantic-JSON-schema work well.)

3. **Orchestration & serving**

* Add a **Reasoning Service** behind your existing API/workflows:

  * `POST /api/v1/insights/compose` → runs decision tables, calls local LLM only if needed, returns structured Insights (summary, sections, actions, confidence).
  * `POST /api/v1/insights/explain` → given an action, produce rationale & operator steps.
* Wire into your **Workflow Orchestration** and **websocket/SSE** progress updates you already ship. &#x20;
* Keep exporting **Google Ads Editor** files via your existing recommendations/export path; the new layer just improves how they’re derived/explained.&#x20;

4. **Knowledge base (optional but powerful)**

* A small, curated, versioned corpus: internal playbooks, Google Ads primitives, common pitfalls. Use retrieval *only* to feed the LLM contexts for explanations; actions still come from rules + analyzer facts.

5. **Safety & gating**

* Gate any model-proposed action behind validation checks, dollar-impact sanity bounds, and “no-surprises” rules (e.g., never add negatives that block converters).
* Confidence scoring: if rule coverage < threshold or model confidence low, mark for human review rather than escalate to a bigger LLM.

## Why this fits PaidSearchNav

* You already have **six analyzers, scheduler, exports, and a full REST backend**. The reasoning layer slots cleanly on top of that without reworking your foundations.  &#x20;
* Your **workflow orchestration** and **S3/customer management** give you a natural home for model assets, rulebooks, and per-tenant configs.&#x20;
* You already support **report generation and recommendations export**; this design upgrades analysis quality without changing deliverables.&#x20;

# Model strategy: tiny, local, commercial-friendly

**Recommended default (quality vs. size):**

* **Mistral 7B Instruct** — **Apache-2.0** (very permissive) and strong general quality. Good first pick for on-prem CPU/GPU serving. ([Mistral AI][1])
* **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** — allowed for commercial use under the **Llama 3.1 Community License** (custom but commercial-friendly). Great if you want broader ecosystem support; check license nuances. ([Llama][2], [Hugging Face][3])
* **Qwen2.5** — many checkpoints (e.g., 14B/7B) are **Apache-2.0**, but **3B** is **non-commercial**; pick variants carefully. ([Hugging Face][4])
* **Phi-3.5 Mini** — **MIT-licensed** small model; excellent for constrained CPU or low-latency scenarios and still permits commercial use. ([Microsoft Azure][5], [Hugging Face][6])

**Serving options (both open-source):**

* **llama.cpp** for CPU-friendly, quantized GGUF deployment (simple, portable; runs 1–8B comfortably on common boxes). ([GitHub][7])
* **vLLM** for high-throughput GPU serving and easy batching/speculative decoding when you need concurrency. ([VLLM Documentation][8])

> Tip: start with Mistral-7B (Q4\_K\_M in llama.cpp for CPU or FP16 on a single modest GPU). If later you want extra headroom for long summaries, swap to Llama-3.1-8B with the same interfaces.

# Build vs. fine-tune vs. rules-only

* **Rules-only**: fastest to ship, repeatable, but brittle on weird edge cases and prose quality. (Still keep this as the backbone.)
* **Off-the-shelf tiny model (no fine-tune)**: surprisingly good for explaining findings; combine with retrieval of your playbook. Cheap, private, commercial-safe (model-dependent).
* **Light fine-tune (LoRA/QLoRA) on your own data**: best blend. Train on pairs of *(Findings IR → Actions + Justifications + Executive Summary)* from past audits. Keep adapters private per tenant if needed. Use the model only for **narrative/edge**; never for raw numbers or thresholds—that remains in rules.

# Concretely, what to implement

## 1) Findings IR (pydantic)

A single, versioned schema per audit that merges all analyzer outputs (counts, rates, spend deltas, conflicts, geo outliers, PMax terms, etc.). You’re already assembling these results—formalize them into one object your reasoning layer consumes.&#x20;

## 2) Decision tables (YAML) → Actions

Example shape:

```yaml
- id: BROAD_TOO_HIGH_LOW_QS
  if_all:
    - expr: "metrics.match_type.broad_pct >= 0.40"
    - expr: "metrics.quality_score.p25 < 5"
  action:
    type: "tighten_match_types"
    target: "top_broad_by_cost"
    params: {limit: 25, new_match: "phrase"}
  justification_template: >
    Broad share is {{ pct(broad_pct) }} with low QS pockets; tighten top {{limit}} to phrase.
  expected_impact:
    spend_savings_usd: "calc:wasted_spend_top_broad"
    risk: "low"
  priority: 1
```

A \~100-rule starter kit usually covers >80% of recommendations deterministically.

## 3) Tiny-LLM writer + edge-case resolver

* **Inputs**: Findings IR, selected Actions, (optionally) KB snippets.
* **Outputs** (strict JSON): { executive\_summary, per\_section\_findings, rationale\_by\_action, changelog\_since\_last\_audit }.
* Enforce structure with pydantic/Guardrails; retry if invalid.

## 4) Reasoning service (API + workflows)

* Endpoints:

  * `POST /api/v1/insights/compose`
  * `POST /api/v1/insights/explain`
* Integrate with your **Workflow API** and **SSE/WS** for live progress messages (e.g., “rules pass 1/3, model pass 2/3”).&#x20;
* Persist generated Insights alongside your existing audit entities; expose via your REST and GraphQL layers.&#x20;

## 5) Guardrails & gating

* Static validations (e.g., no negative keyword that matches a top-converting term).
* Cost/risk bounds per tenant.
* Confidence logic (fallback to “needs review” if rule coverage < X or model self-score < Y).
* Diff viewer to compare recommended changes vs previous audits (you already support compare/trends; reuse).&#x20;

## 6) (Optional) Light fine-tune

* Collect (Findings IR, rules-Actions, human-edited text) triples from past audits.
* SFT a 7B model with LoRA; keep adapters private in S3 and load at serve-time per tenant.
* Evaluate with held-out audits; accept adapters that improve *readability* and *edge-case coverage* without regressing facts.

# What to run where

* **Default CPU path**: llama.cpp + Mistral-7B Q4 quant; great cost/latency for single-digit concurrency. ([GitHub][7])
* **GPU path**: vLLM + Mistral-7B or Llama-3.1-8B for higher throughput; also easiest to add speculative decoding later. ([VLLM Documentation][8])
* **Licensing at a glance** (verify per checkpoint):

  * Mistral-7B: Apache-2.0. ([Mistral AI][1])
  * Llama-3.1-8B: commercial use allowed under Meta’s Llama 3.1 Community License. ([Llama][2], [Hugging Face][3])
  * Qwen-2.5: many variants Apache-2.0 (e.g., 14B); **3B is non-commercial**—avoid for your product. ([Hugging Face][4])
  * Phi-3.5 Mini: MIT-licensed small model—fully commercial-friendly. ([Microsoft Azure][5])

# Why not “build your own” model from scratch?

You don’t need to. Your IP is in **(a)** the analyzer signal and **(b)** the rulebook + curated KB + tuning data. A modest LoRA on a 7B-class model already captures your “voice” and edge patterns without the cost or complexity of pretraining.

---

## Quick, actionable plan

1. **Define Findings IR** covering all analyzers + dollar impacts.
2. **Draft 60–100 decision table rules** for your top issues (match-type tightening, negative conflicts, PMax search terms, geo outliers).
3. Stand up **llama.cpp** with Mistral-7B (CPU) and add the **Reasoning Service** endpoints above.
4. Implement **structured JSON output** with pydantic validation + retries; never trust free-text.
5. Add **confidence & gating** and wire insights into your existing API/workflows and report generation. &#x20;
6. (Optional) **Fine-tune** on your own audit corpus via LoRA adapters for better tone/edge handling.
